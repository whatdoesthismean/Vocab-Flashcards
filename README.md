# Vocab-Flashcards
Japanese Vocab Flashcard Program

I made this using Visual Basic. It took all the programming skills I have plus some trial and error and googling.

It requires 2 text files that I haven't figured out how to include:
 - nihongo.txt with one Japanese kana word per line
 - eng.txt with the matching English translation on each line
 
 I doubt the fonts I used are inlcuded either.
