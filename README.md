# Vocab-Flashcards
Japanese Vocab Flashcard Program

I made this using Visual Basic. It took all the programming skills I have plus some trial and error and googling.

It requires 2 text files that I haven't figured out how to include:
 - nihongo.txt with one Japanese kana word per line
 - eng.txt with the matching English translation on each line
 
 I doubt the font I used is inlcuded either.
 At the time of this writing it is available here:

 It's called corporate logo (round) version 2.
